A\nlittle bit of background about myself\u2014 I was born in Kobe, Japan,\nhowever, I moved with my family to the San Francisco Bay Area\nwhen I was very young.

I have learned the ins and outs of research\nadministration, which has improved my domain knowledge in\nbusiness and finance. \nIn the Fall of 2023, I enrolled in the USC Master of Science in\nBusiness Analytics program to work in multicultural and cross-\nfunctional teams to make myself even more competitive in the job\nmarket.\nWithin the next two years, I hope to eventually work as a business\nanalyst.
