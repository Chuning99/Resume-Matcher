Leveraging my\nunique blend of design and development expertise, I serve as a liaison to\nfacilitate communication between both factions. I assist fellow Computer\nScience students from Brown University in understanding the user flow of\nthe design work, which includes elements like egress, geosampling, and\nnavigation. Simultaneously, I aid developers in articulating technical issues\nto the designers. Beyond this, my specific role involves developing the user\ninterface within Unity for HoloLens, with a primary focus on icon development.\nRhode Island School of Design\nGraphic Designer\nJuly 2022\u00a0-\u00a0December 2022\u00a0 (6 months)\nProvidence, Rhode Island, United States\nDuring my tenure at RISD, I collaborated with the ISSA office to design and\ndisseminate a variety of online graphics.
