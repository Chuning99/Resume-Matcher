Currently\nin my first year of the MS in Business Analytics program at USC,\nI collaborate with a cohort of talented and diverse individuals to\ntackle in-class and extracurricular projects aimed at refining business\ninsights and creating a real-life impact.\nI graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with dual degrees in\nEconomics & Statistics and Philosophy, which may not seem like the\nmost intuitive combination, but my interests in these disparate fields\nare deeply intertwined. I enjoy piecing together a consistent theory\nfrom some of the most obscure texts ever written just as much as\nuncovering patterns hidden beneath a dazzling display of data. With\nintellectual curiosity and enriching, diverse experiences connecting\ninterdisciplinary ideas, I add value to a variety of academic and\nprofessional organizations by translating my analysis into actionable\ninsights. When placed in a team setting, my inclination toward an\nintegrative approach to problem-solving motivates me to bring top\nminds together for complex tasks, which are often interdisciplinary in\nnature.\nI have a strong academic track record in conducting statistical\nanalysis and professional exposure to processing and extracting\ninsights from real-world datasets. I am proficient in R, Python, and\nMySQL, with a focus on data analytics, visualization, and database\nmanagement. A strong suit of mine is conducting literature reviews,\nand I particularly enjoy complementing quantitative analysis with\nabundant qualitative research. I believe that being data-driven is just\nas important as being hypothesis-driven, where domain knowledge is\ncrucial.\n\u00a0 Page 1 of 3 \u00a0 \u00a0\nMy industry interests lie in retail, healthcare, and marketing. I am\nactively seeking data-oriented internship opportunities in Summer\n2024, with a flexible location preference for California, New York,\nand Pittsburgh, which is my second home.
