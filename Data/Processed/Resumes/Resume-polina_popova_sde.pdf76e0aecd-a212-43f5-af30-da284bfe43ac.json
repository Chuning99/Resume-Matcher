These\ntwo factors define me very well.\nI have humanitarian education, and I am proud of it. Since we are\nmostly working with people and for people, it really helps to be a\nmore conscious member of the team.\nI like coding, but what I enjoy is solving problems. \nMy leading superpower is engagement and curiosity: engagement in\nthe teamwork and processes and into the product we build. \nI value working in a team, so before pushing something, I check\nif it is important for the people around me and how it fits the\ncircumstances. So yes, I ask many questions. And if it is only one\nanswer \u201cit is historically\u201d and you are not up to go into details - it is\nnot in my way.\nEverywhere I came, I try to contribute to the community. My first\ntechnical talk was about git architecture and lessons we can learn\nfrom it, in the 3 months after my internship has finished. \nI have mentored around 5 new team members and have received\npositive feedback from the managers and mentees.\nI promote TDD by example and some of my colleagues started to\nuse it on their out initiative. Now we have reached 86% test coverage\nfor the main features.\nIn my current company, I run the pair programming experiment, and\nnow it is a common practice for knowledge sharing in my team. Also,\nI am introducing SRE culture right now.\n\u00a0 Page 1 of 4 \u00a0 \u00a0\nI believe I empower the technical culture around me through this,\nand I like it.\nExperience\nATI.SU\n2 years 8 months\nTechnical Lead\nDecember 2021\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (1 year 11 months)\nBudapest, Hungary\n- Launched several features, from the definition of done and tasks\ndecomposition to managing the production release.\n- Introduced pair programming for complicated tasks to spread knowledge\namong team members.\n- Restructured monitoring and alerting process, decreased notifications\nnoise, made alerts more informative, set up incident management rules, and\nincreased feature coverage by alerts to 60%.\nAbout project:\nSystem for the exchange of electronic documents with judicial value.
