Weekly I assist in grassroots initiatives led\nby my field and advocacy managers. I help facilitate meetings by leading\nbrainstorming sessions to help foster innovative solutions. I help my education\ndirector build curriculum for future fellows and volunteers for efficient and\nholistic onboarding. I lead projects and manage events by developing assets\nand reports.

My role as an intern was to assist within\neach department on a diverse set of projects. For the pre-development team\nI researched city ordinances in respective cities to inform project parameters.\nI would often participate in site inspections and document key findings. From\nhere I would collaborate with the planning and strategy team by mapping data\nin GIS to inform planning techniques. My research was self-facilitated, so I\nlearned time management and how to deliver clear concise findings to my\nsupervisors. This research and analysis informed parts of our annual plan\nfor the Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Resort. To assist the design team\nI produced maps, project concepts, decks, or presentations for leadership.\nThese deliverables often were to bridge the gap of communication between\nour Master Planning team to other parts of WDI. My time as a master planning\nintern taught me multi-disciplinary collaboration, attention to detail and skills to\ncommunicate through different mediums.\nNoHo Business Improvement District\nIntern\nMay 2018\u00a0-\u00a0August 2018\u00a0 (4 months)\nGreater New York City Area\nI ran data research for the BID, maintained its database for future usage,\ninterfaced with the local businesses, and collaborated with the other 73 BIDs\nthroughout the city. The maintenance of data was crucial in documenting the\nhistory of the community and its buildings. Mainly working in excel, I populated\n\u00a0 Page 2 of 3 \u00a0 \u00a0\nand organized the data for future uses. I engaged with the community and\nlearned to be receptive to the concerns of the people. This enabled me to help\nguide the BID\u2019s initiatives. Working directly with the community has taught me\nthe importance of being attentive to user needs, communication, and patience.\nEducation\nTexas A&M University\nBachelor of Science - BS,\u00a0Urban and Regional Planning \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(2016\u00a0-\u00a02019)\n\u00a0 Page 3 of 3",
