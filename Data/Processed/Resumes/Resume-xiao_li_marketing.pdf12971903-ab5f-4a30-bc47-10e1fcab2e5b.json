I realized that with effective research, a compelling narrative,\nand the right strategy, the impossible could be achieved in the digital\nrealm.\nThen, the passion I searched for my first 20 years ignited. \nI became obsessed with the thrill of bridging the gap between virtual\nresults and data, weaving compelling stories from fragmented\ninformation. I enjoy the adrenaline rush every time when launching\nsuccessful campaigns and break DAU(daily active users) records\nagain and again.\nAs a current Digital Social Media student at Annenberg, a successful\nentrepreneur behind two media projects, a marketing intern at\nBytedance, and a youth who rocks her multicultural background,\nI am confident in my ability to harness the power of data and\nstorytelling to effect meaningful change in the digital sphere.\n- Media Strategies/Branding\n- Digital Marketing\n- Media Analysis\n- Media Content Creation\nLet's connect and embark on this journey together!\n\u00a0 Page 1 of 3 \u00a0 \u00a0\nExperience\nUSC Annenberg Media\nDigital Media Producer\nAugust 2023\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (3 months)\n\u7f8e\u56fd \u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde \u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\nConceptualize, host, and edit video content for the Annenberg Media\nInstagram and TikTok account, achieving success with one video garnering\n51.8k views and other videos consistently driving high engagement rates.\n\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\nDigital Marketing Intern\nAugust 2022\u00a0-\u00a0December 2022\u00a0 (5 months)\n\u2022 Identified the issue of low synchronization rates of platform and increased it\nby 28% through crawling content and sampling analysis, and addressed the\nissue by modifying the product page. \n\u2022 Cultivated a Headline Media Partner Program, maintaining over 30\ninfluencers, and designed a media incentive strategy that promoted 47\nheadlines and increased media interaction by 41%. \n\u2022 Acquiring 128 high-value content creators by driving the outreach team to\nfacilitate content creator acquisition and establishing a sourcing value chain. \n\u2022 Managed the campaign of the national journalist festival, established a\ncooperative relationship with 14 university communication departments,\ncontributing to the acquisition of 39 quality content creators and increasing\nactivity click rate to 1 billion.\n\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\nNew Media Intern\nJuly 2021\u00a0-\u00a0September 2021\u00a0 (3 months)\n\u2022 Developed an automated billboard of trending topics to reduce manual\ncollection manpower by five hours per week. \n\u2022 Generated over 10 articles for Phoenix\u2019s official WeChat account, garnering\n500,000 views, and generated three microblogging posts with over 10 million\nviews. \n\u00a0 Page 2 of 3 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2022 Maintained an online community of over 500 content creators by feeding\ntopics and providing resources, increasing the number of weekly active\ncreators by 24% and channel DAU growth by 23%.\nYiyou Public Welfare Foundation\nBrand Marketing Intern\nJune 2021\u00a0-\u00a0September 2021\u00a0 (4 months)\n\u2022 Researched public welfare industry dynamics to evaluate brand strategies\nand compiled reports providing over 10 recommendations for brand\nimprovement.\n\u2022 Pursued in planning the welfare project, From the Mountains, and\ncollaborated with the Soong Ching Ling Foundation to provide vocal learning\nopportunities for over 1,000 left-behind children.\nChengdu TV station\nMedia Intern\nJune 2020\u00a0-\u00a0August 2020\u00a0 (3 months)\n\u2022 Liaised with 17 district and county-level media platforms weekly, and ensured\nthe efficiency and effectiveness of article submission by implementing an\nonline communication mechanism. \n\u2022 Reviewed and edited over 50 articles submitted by district platforms.  \n\u2022 Assisted in the upgrade of the Chengdu Learning Platform App and\nparticipated in preliminary research of target users and interface interaction\ndesign of the app, increasing the penetration rate by 67%.\nEducation\nUSC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism\nMaster of Science - MS,\u00a0Digital Social Media \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(August 2023\u00a0-\u00a0April 2025)\n\u5317\u4eac\u5de5\u5546\u5927\u5b66\nBachelor of Arts - BA,\u00a0Journalism \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(September 2019\u00a0-\u00a0July 2023)\n\u00a0 Page 3 of 3",
